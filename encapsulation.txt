Encapsulation is wrapping out of data & member functions in a single unit called class.

**Explanation: It works by bundling the data (variables) and 
the methods that operate on that data inside a single class, 
while restricting direct access from outside the class. 
Instead of allowing external code to modify values freely, 
encapsulation protects the data by making variables private and 
providing public methods such as getters and setters to 
control how the data is accessed or updated. 
This prevents invalid or harmful changes, increases code security, 
and makes programs easier to maintain. By hiding the internal details 
and exposing only what is necessary, encapsulation helps 
keep the structure of the code clean, modular, and easy to 
understand.
