Polymorphism allows the same function or method to behave differently 
depending on the object that calls it. In simple terms, it means 
"many forms". With polymorphism, you can write one common interface 
(like a function name) and use it for different underlying forms 
(different class objects). For example, if multiple classes have a 
function named draw(), calling draw() on a circle object draws a circle, 
while calling draw() on a rectangle object draws a rectangle — even though 
the function name is the same. This makes code more flexible, easier to 
extend, and cleaner because you can work with different types of objects 
using the same method or interface.
